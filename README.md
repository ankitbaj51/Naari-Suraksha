# Some feautures of the app:
# 1) In this app a pre-written message template is already generated so that the user does not need to type the message when in danger.
# 2) The app provides the services of live location tracking and SMS sending, so that the user does not need to access the map application to send the location, instead the        user just needs to click on a single button to share the location via SMS and her location will be shared with her emergency contacts.
