# Naari-Suraksha:A women safety app
One in three women have experienced some kind of physical or sexual violence, according to the World Health Organization. Considering the high rate of incidents globally, it is only natural for women to have suppressed and internalised deep emotional and psychological trauma. Over hundreds of years, this kind of uninterrupted and powerful stress has impacted their mobility and prevented them from realising their true potential, hampering not just the individual, but societies and economies at large. To drive gender balance for economic progress, it is important that our ‘engines of growth’ – our cities –  become safer, more secure and comfortable for women. In 2012, the gruesome ‘Nirbhaya’ gang rape in the nation’s capital city Delhi, triggered outrage not only in India but across the world, compelling the government to overhaul anti-rape laws.
A host of new apps have been developed to provide security systems to women on their phones like 'FIGHT BACK','GUARD','LIFE 360',etc.
Here I introduce 'NARI SURAKSHA' an app which will ensure the safety of women at all times. It makes into use GPS system that costs very low in comparison to the other navigation systems.

# Some feautures of the app:
# 1) In this app a pre-written message template is already generated so that the user does not need to type the message when in danger.
# 2) The app provides the services of live location tracking and SMS sending, so that the user does not need to access the map application to send the location, instead the        user just needs to click on a single button to share the location via SMS and her location will be shared with her emergency contacts.
